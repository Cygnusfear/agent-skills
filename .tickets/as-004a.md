# Work in /Users/alexander/Projects/agent-skills

Create a new playbook skill `20-06-premortem` for the obsidian-plan-wiki skill.

## What

A premortem skill — before starting significant work, imagine the project has FAILED and work backwards to identify failure modes. The inverse of a post-mortem (20.05).

## Research

Fetch and incorporate ideas from these sources:
- https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/managing-risk-on-agile-projects-with-the-risk-burndown-chart
- https://asana.com/resources/premortem
- https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/use-a-pre-mortem-to-identify-project-risks-before-they-occur
- https://github.com/openclaw/skills/blob/main/skills/artyomx33/pre-mortem-analyst/SKILL.md

Adapt for agent development workflow, NOT corporate project management.

## Writing Guidelines

Before writing, read these skills and follow their guidance:
1. Read `/Users/alexander/.pi/agent/skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` — follow skill creation best practices
2. Read `/Users/alexander/.pi/agent/skills/writing-clearly-and-concisely/SKILL.md` — apply concise writing rules
3. Read `/Users/alexander/.pi/agent/skills/create-skill/SKILL.md` — follow SKILL.md structure

## Output

Create the file at: `skills/obsidian-plan-wiki/playbook/20-git/20-06-premortem/SKILL.md`

Frontmatter:
- name: 20-06-premortem
- description: should describe WHEN to use (before risky work), not WHAT it does

Also update `skills/obsidian-plan-wiki/SKILL.md` — add `20.06` to the playbook table after the `20.05` entry.

Also sync the new file to `/Users/alexander/.agents/skills/obsidian-plan-wiki/playbook/20-git/20-06-premortem/SKILL.md` and update `/Users/alexander/.agents/skills/obsidian-plan-wiki/SKILL.md` with the table entry.

## Key Principles

- Lightweight — not a 2-hour corporate exercise, something an agent can run in 5 minutes
- Output goes into a tk ticket tagged `premortem`
- Focus on: what could go wrong, what's the blast radius, what mitigations exist
- One page max
- Blameless future-thinking, not paranoia
- Fits the 20-git area because it gates risky operations (rebases, refactors, deploys)

## Notes

**2026-02-14T11:54:54Z**

Starting work. Reading writing guidelines and research sources.

**2026-02-14T11:55:50Z**

DONE: Created 20-06-premortem skill at both skills/obsidian-plan-wiki/playbook/20-git/20-06-premortem/SKILL.md and ~/.pi/agent/skills/... mirror. Lightweight 5-minute premortem process: set scene → list failure modes → rate/prioritize → define mitigations → set tripwires. Output goes to tk ticket tagged premortem. Updated both parent SKILL.md files with 20.06 table entry. Incorporated ideas from Mountain Goat Software (pre-mortem technique), Asana (structured process), and openclaw/artyomx33 skill (categories/format), adapted for agent dev workflow.

**2026-02-14T11:55:57Z**

DONE: Task completed.
