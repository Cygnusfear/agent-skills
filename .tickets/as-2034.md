# Convert the obsidian-plan-wiki skill's handbook entries from flat .md files to SKILL.md directory format (the 'playbook' pattern).

Work in: /Users/alexander/.pi/agent/skills/obsidian-plan-wiki/

Task: Convert every file in `handbook/` from the current flat format to directory+SKILL.md format.

Current: `handbook/20-git/20.01-methodic-rebase-merge.md`
New: `playbook/20-git/20.01-methodic-rebase-merge/SKILL.md`

For each file:
1. Create the new directory under `playbook/` (same area structure)
2. Move the content into `SKILL.md` with added frontmatter:
```yaml
---
name: <ID>-<slug>
description: <one-line description based on content>
---
```
3. Keep the body content exactly as-is (don't rewrite)

All 15 entries:
- handbook/10-docs/10.01-open-questions-system.md
- handbook/10-docs/10.02-question-archive.md
- handbook/10-docs/10.03-obsidian-flow.md
- handbook/15-planning/15.02-spec-divergence.md
- handbook/15-planning/15.03-ticket-divergence.md
- handbook/15-planning/15.04-review-to-tickets.md
- handbook/20-git/20.01-methodic-rebase-merge.md
- handbook/20-git/20.02-authoritative-main-rebase.md
- handbook/20-git/20.03-merge-local-safe.md
- handbook/20-git/20.04-post-merge-hygiene.md
- handbook/30-refactor/30.01-full-refactor-guide.md
- handbook/50-testing/50.01-video-based-nhitl-testing.md
- handbook/80-agent-behaviour/80.01-autonomous-work.md
- handbook/80-agent-behaviour/80.02-document-feature.md
- handbook/80-agent-behaviour/80.03-stale-trees.md

After creating all playbook entries, DELETE the old handbook/ directory.

Do NOT touch SKILL.md (the main skill file) or anything in references/ — another worker handles that.
