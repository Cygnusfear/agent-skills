# Work in ~/Projects/skillbook. Run 10.03

Work in ~/Projects/skillbook. Run 10.03


## Notes

**2026-02-14T08:11:36Z**

Starting work. Need to work in ~/Projects/skillbook and run 10.03.

**2026-02-14T08:12:06Z**

DONE: Ran playbook 10.03 (file headers audit) on ~/Projects/skillbook. Scanned all 4 src/*.js files (cities.js, router.js, server.js, weather.js). All files already have correct standard headers with @module, @area weather-api, and @playbook 10.03. No fixes needed.

**2026-02-14T08:12:09Z**

DONE: Task completed.
