# 20.03 Merge Local Safe (Merge)

⛔ **ONLY RUN THIS AFTER HUMAN CONFIRMED WITH `[M]`**

## Instructions:

when you are 100% sure you can guarantee a safe merge, you want to merge your branch to `local main` from `local main`

## ⛔ STOP HERE — WAIT FOR HUMAN

Report merge result. Do NOT proceed to cleanup (20.04) without human confirmation.
