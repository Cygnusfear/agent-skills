# 20.02 Authoritative-Main Rebase (Execute)

⛔ **ONLY RUN THIS AFTER HUMAN CONFIRMED WITH `[R]`**

## Instructions:

When you are 100% sure a rebase would not drop changes from existing main (main changes generally are authoritative- **if in any way you are not 100% sure ask hooman**) then **rebase** - **DO NOT MERGE YET**

## ⛔ STOP HERE — WAIT FOR HUMAN

Report the rebase result. Do NOT proceed to merge (20.03).
The human must explicitly say `[M]` before you merge.
